# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS and Jenkins

### This project showcases the implementation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, AWS, and Jenkins to automate the provisioning of remote Ansible nodes and a control node. The infrastructure is designed for Ansible automation, facilitating system configuration and management. 

### Below are the key components and features of this project:

## Prerequisite

- Visit the below website if you are installing Jenkins for other Images

``` https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/ ```

## STEP 5:
### What is terraform.tfstate file?
- The terraform.tfstate file is used by Terraform to keep track of the current state of your infrastructure. It stores information about the resources that Terraform has created, their attributes, and their dependencies.

- The terraform.tfstate file may contain sensitive information, such as resource IDs, IP addresses, or secrets. Therefore, it should be stored securely and not exposed to unauthorized users.

- By default, Terraform stores the terraform.tfstate file locally in the same directory as your Terraform configuration files. However, it's recommended to use remote state storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Consul) for production environments to enable collaboration and prevent state file corruption.

- The terraform.tfstate file may contain sensitive information, such as resource IDs, IP addresses, or secrets. Therefore, it should be stored securely and not exposed to unauthorized users. Therefore As mentioned earlier, using remote state storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Consul) is the best practice for collaborating on Terraform projects. It provides better security, versioning, and concurrent access control.

### Creating Remote-Backend.
- Login to the AWS GUI
- Search for S3-Bucket
- Click on Create a New Bucket
![Screenshot 2023-09-24 220514](https://github.com/180172/Terraform-project-2/assets/110009356/528b5cf2-8287-4c66-b27a-354af49266f6)
- Add the bucket name. The bucket name must be unique.
- Select a region and click on Create a bucket
![Screenshot 2023-09-24 220850](https://github.com/180172/Terraform-project-2/assets/110009356/ef40df9e-890c-4b3d-be94-4993a95aed86)


- Open the bucket that you have created 
- Click on Create Create folder
![Screenshot 2023-09-24 221059](https://github.com/180172/Terraform-project-2/assets/110009356/c47b766f-14f1-4398-948d-87e9b34a774c)
- Add the folder name and click on Create.

## STEP 6:
### What is state locking & Why is state locking
- Terraform uses a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent state modifications. This is crucial when working with teams to avoid conflicts and ensure data integrity.

- There is a possibility that two developers will push changes to the Terraform code when more than two developers are working on the same project. if more than one request is made simultaneously to the terraform.tfstate file. The tfstate file will become corrupted. We are using the state-locking feature to stop this.


- Terraform maintains its state file locally by default. When a terraform operation is being carried out locally, the state file is automatically locked utilizing APIs.

- All backends will not support the Terraform state-locking feature. In order to learn about the statelocking feature, we must read the documentation.

- Some of the popular backends include:
- S3
- Consul
- Azurerm
- Kubernetes
- HTTP
- ETCD

### Creating DynamoDB table

- Search for DynamoDB in AWS
- Click on Create a table
  
![Screenshot 2023-09-24 224045](https://github.com/180172/Terraform-project-2/assets/110009356/4c1b61b9-1008-4d32-bced-63070416dca9)

- Add the table name
- The partition key must be "LockID" and it should be of type "String"

![Screenshot 2023-09-24 224210](https://github.com/180172/Terraform-project-2/assets/110009356/a70e6afc-f213-4181-81dd-8f3b671df2b5)

- Click on Create a table

## STEP 7:
### Create a GitHub repo

- Create a GitHub repo it might be public or private.

- Clone the repo to the EC2 instance.

- Generate the ssh-key in the EC2 instance by running the command

``` 
ssh-keygen
```

- Copy the public key and open your GitHub. On the right side corner under your profile select "Settings"

- Select SSH and GPJ keys and click on New SSH key
- Add the ".pub_rsa" key selected from EC2 and save

## STEP 8:
### Configure the Jenkins

- Now our work is almost completed. Let's create a Jenkins job and trigger the job.
- Open the Jenkins dashboard
- Click on New Item. Enter the ITEAM name select PIPELINE and click on OK.

- Under General select "This project is parameterised". Name the parameter and under choices add apply and destroy. This step is used to trigger the job. When you configure the job a prompt will pop up and it will ask you if this job is running to apply the infrastructure or to destroy the infrastructure.
